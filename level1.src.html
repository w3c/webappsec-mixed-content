  <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

  <em>This section is not normative.</em>

  When a user successfully loads a resource from example.com over a secure
  channel (HTTPS, for example), the user agent is able to make three assertions
  critical to the user's security and privacy:

  <ul>
    <li>
      The user is communicating with a server that is allowed to claim to be
      <code>example.com</code>, and not one of the many, many servers through
      which her request has hopped. The connection can be
      <strong>authenticated</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
      The user's communications with <code>example.com</code> cannot be
      trivially eavesdropped upon by middlemen, because the requests she makes
      and the responses she receives are <strong>encrypted</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
      The user's communications with <code>example.com</code> cannot be
      trivially modified by middlemen, the encryption and authentication
      provide a guarantee of <strong>data integrity</strong>.
    </li>
  </ul>

  Together, these assertions give the user some assurance that
  <code>example.com</code> is the only entity that can read and respond to her
  requests (caveat: without shocking amounts of work) and that the bits she's
  received are indeed those that <code>example.com</code> actually sent.

  The strength of these assertions is substantially weakened, however, when
  the encrypted and authenticated resource requests subresources (scripts,
  images, etc) over an insecure channel. Those resource requests result in a
  resource whose status is mixed, as insecure requests are wide open for
  man-in-the-middle attacks. This scenario is unfortunately quite common.

  This specification details how a user agent can mitigate these risks to
  security and privacy by limiting a resource's ability to inadvertently
  communicate in the clear.

  Note: Nothing described in this document is really new; everything covered
  here has appeared in one or more user agents over the years: Internet
  Explorer led the way, alerting users to mixed content since
  <a href="https://twitter.com/ericlaw/status/469813922908758016">around</a>
  version 4.

  <h2 id="terms">Key Concepts and Terminology</h2>

  <dl>
    <dt>
      <dfn export local-lt="mixed">mixed content</dfn>
    </dt>
    <dd>
      A <a>request</a> is <strong>mixed content</strong> if its
      <a for="request">url</a> is not <a><i lang="la">a priori</i>
      authenticated</a>, <strong>and</strong> the context responsible for
      loading it prohibits mixed security contexts (see
      [[#categorize-settings-object]] for a normative definition of the latter).

      A <a>response</a> is <strong>mixed content</strong> if it is an
      <a>unauthenticated response</a>, <strong>and</strong> the context
      responsible for loading it prohibits mixed security contexts.

      <div class="example">
        Inside a context that restricts mixed content
        (<code>https://secure.example.com/</code>, for example):

        1.  A request for the script <code>http://example.com/script.js</code>
            is <strong>mixed content</strong>. As script <a>requests</a> are
            <a>blockable</a>, the user agent will return a network error rather
            than loading the resource.

        2.  A request for the image <code>http://example.com/image.png</code> is
            <strong>mixed content</strong>. As image <a>requests</a> are
            <a>optionally-blockable</a>, the user agent might load the image, in
            which case the image resource itself would be <strong>mixed
            content</strong>.
      </div>

      If mixed content is loaded into a context that restricts mixed content
      (as in #2 above), that context is considered a <a>mixed security
      context</a> (as defined in [[!RFC6797]]).

      Note: "Mixed content" was originally defined in
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wsc-ui/#securepage">section 5.3</a> of
      [[WSC-UI]]. This document updates that initial definition.

      Note: [[XML]] also defines an unrelated 
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-xml-20081126/#sec-mixed-content">"mixed content"</a>.
      concept. This is potentially confusing, but given the term's near
      ubiquitious usage in a security context across user agents for more than
      a decade, the practical risk of confusion seems low.

    </dt>
    <dd>
      We know <i lang="la">a priori</i> that a request to a particular URL
      (|url|) will be delivered in a way that mitigates the risks of
      interception and modifications if either of the following statements is

      1.  |url| is a [=potentially trustworthy URL=] [[!SECURE-CONTEXTS]].

      2.  |url|'s <a for="url">scheme</a> is "`data`".

          Note: We special case `data` URLs here, as we don't consider them
          particularly trustworthy, but we also don't wish to block them as
          mixed content, as they never hit the network.

<section>
  <h2 id="categories">Content Categories</h2>

  In a perfect world, each user agent would be required to block all <a>mixed
  content</a> without exception. Unfortunately, that is impractical on today's
  Internet; a user agent needs to be more nuanced in its restrictions to avoid
  degrading the experience on a substantial number of websites.

  With that in mind, we here split mixed content into two categories:
  [[#category-optionally-blockable]] and [[#category-blockable]].

  Note: Future versions of this specification will update this categorization
  with the intent of moving towards a world where all <a>mixed</a> content is
  blocked; that is the end goal, but this is the best we can do for now.

  <section>
    <h3 id="category-optionally-blockable">Optionally-blockable Content</h3>

    Mixed content is
    <dfn export lt="optionally-blockable mixed content" local-lt="optionally-blockable">optionally-blockable</dfn>
    when the risk of allowing its usage as <a>mixed content</a> is outweighed by the risk of
    breaking significant portions of the web. This could be because mixed usage of the resource type
    is sufficiently high, and because the resource is low-risk in and of itself. The fact that these
    resource types are optionally-blockable does not mean that they are <em>safe</em>, simply that
    they're less catastrophically dangerous than other resource types. For example, images and icons
    are often the central UI elements in an application's interface. If an attacker reversed the
    "Delete email" and "Reply" icons, there would be real impact to users.

    This category includes:

    *   Requests whose [=request/initiator=] is the empty string, and whose [=request/destination=]
        is "`image`".

        Note: This corresponds to most images loaded via <{img}> (including SVG documents loaded as
        images, as those are blocked from executing script or fetching subresources) and CSS
        ('background-image', 'border-image', etc). It does not include <{img}> elements that [=use
        srcset or picture=].

    *   Requests whose [=request/destination=] is "`video`".

        Note: This corresponds to video loaded via <{video}> and <{source}>.

    *   Requests whose [=request/destination=] is "`audio`".

        Note: This corresponds to audio loaded via <{audio}> and <{source}>.

    We further limit this category in [[#should-block-fetch]] by force-failing any CORS-enabled
    request. This means, for example, that mixed content images loaded via `<img crossorigin ...>`
    will be blocked. This is a good example of the general principle that content falls into this
    category <em>only</em> when it is too widely used to be blocked outright. The Working Group
    intends to carve out more blockable subsets as time goes on.
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3 id="category-blockable">Blockable Content</h3>

    Any mixed content that is not [=optionally-blockable=] as defined above is considered to be
    <dfn export lt="blockable mixed content" local-lt="blockable">blockable</dfn>. Typical examples
    of this kind of content include scripts, <a>plugin</a> data, data requested via
    {{XMLHttpRequest}}, and so on.

    Note: <a>Navigation requests</a> might target <a>top-level browsing contexts</a>; these are not
    considered mixed content. See [[#should-block-fetch]] for details.

    Note: Note that requests made on behalf of a plugin are blockable. We recognize, however, that
    user agents aren't always in a position to mediate these requests. NPAPI plugins, for instance,
    often have direct network access, and can generally bypass the user agent entirely. We recommend
    that user agents block these requests when possible, and that plugin vendors implement mixed
    content checking themselves to mitigate the risks outlined in this document.

<!-- Big Text: strict mode -->
<section>
  <h2 id="strict-checking">Strict Mixed Content Checking</h2>

  In order to give authors assurance that mixed content will never degrade the
  security UI presented to their users (as described in [[#requirements-ux]]),
  authors may choose to enable a stricter variant of mixed content checking
  which will both block <a>optionally-blockable</a> and <a>blockable</a> mixed
  content, and suppress the user override options discussed in
  [[#requirements-user-controls]].

  To this end, {{Document}} objects and <a>browsing contexts</a> have a
  <dfn>strict mixed content checking flag</dfn> which is set to
  <code>false</code> unless otherwise specified. This flag is checked in both
  [[#should-block-fetch]] and [[#should-block-response]] to determine whether
  the {{Document}} is in <dfn>strict mode</dfn>.

  <div class="example">
    A {{Document}} may opt itself into strict mode by either delivering a
    <code>Content-Security-Policy</code> HTTP header, like:

    <pre>
      Content-Security-Policy: <a>block-all-mixed-content</a>
    </pre>

    or by embedding the policy in a <a element>meta</a> element, like:

    <pre>
      &lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy"
            content="<a>block-all-mixed-content</a>"&gt;
    </pre>
  </div>

  Note: Strict mixed content checking is inherited by embedded content; if
  a page opts into strict mode, framed pages will be prevented from loading
  mixed content, as described in [[#strict-nesting]].

  <h3 id="strict-effects">Effects</h3>

  If a {{Document}}'s <a>strict mixed content checking flag</a> is set to
  <code>true</code>, the user agent MUST:

  <ol>
    <li>
      treat <a>optionally-blockable</a> mixed content as though it were
      <a>blockable</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      NOT provide users with a mechanism for forcing <a>blockable</a>
      mixed content to load.

      Note: This requirement overrides the suggestion in
      [[#requirements-user-controls]].
    </li>
    <li>
      NOT provide any user-facing indication that mixed content is present.

      Note: This requirement overrides the suggestion in [[#requirements-ux]],
      which is safe to do since the combination of the first and second
      requirements above ensure that mixed content will never load in this
      page's context.

      Note: This requirement does not include developer-facing indicators such
      as console messages.
    </li>
    <li>
      ensure that these requirements are applied to any {{Document}} in a
      <a>nested browsing context</a>, as described in [[#strict-nesting]].
    </li>
  </ol>
  
  <h3 id="strict-opt-in">Opting-in</h3>

  Authors may opt a {{Document}} into strict mixed content checking via a
  <dfn>block-all-mixed-content</dfn> Content Security Policy directive
  [[!CSP3]], defined via the following ABNF grammar.

  <pre>
    directive-name  = "block-all-mixed-content"
    directive-value = ""
  </pre>

  This directive will trigger violation reports for mixed content on a page.
  Details are found in [[#should-block-fetch]].

  Note: A similar effect may be achieved on a more granular level by setting
  individual directives. For example <code>img-src https:</code> would prevent
  insecure images from loading.
  
  <h3 id="directive-initialization">`block-all-mixed-content` Initialization</h3>
  
  `block-all-mixed-content`'s [=directive/initialization=] algorithm is as
  follows:

  Given a {{Document}} or <a for="/">global object</a> (|context|), a <a>response</a>
  (|response|), and a <a for="/">Content Security Policy object</a> (|policy|):

  1.  Assert: |response| is unused.

  2.  If |policy|'s <a for="policy">disposition</a> is not "`enforce`", then abort this algorithm.

  3.  Set |context|'s [=strict mixed content checking flag=] to `true`.

  <h3 id="strict-nesting">Inheriting an opt-in</h3>

  If a {{Document}}'s <a>strict mixed content checking flag</a> is set, the user
  agent MUST ensure that all <a>nested browsing contexts</a> inherit the setting
  in the following ways:

  <ol>
    <li>
      When a <a>nested browsing context</a> <var>context</var> is created, set
      its <a>strict mixed content checking flag</a> to <code>true</code> if 
      <var>context</var>'s <a>embedding document</a>'s <a>strict mixed content
      checking flag</a> is set to <code>true</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
      When <a lt="create and initialize a Document object">initializing a new
      <code>Document</code> object</a>, set its <a>strict mixed content checking
      flag</a> to <code>true</code> if its <a>browsing context</a>'s <a>strict
      mixed content checking flag</a> is <code>true</code>.
    </li>
  </ol>

<section>
  <h2 id="algorithms">Insecure Content in Secure Contexts</h2>

  At a high level, the following algorithms allow user agents to determine
  whether particular requests should succeed, or should result in network
  errors.

  Fetch calls the algorithm defined in [[#should-block-fetch]] at the top of
  the fetching algorithm in order to block network traffic to
  <a for="request">URL</a>s which are not <a><i lang="la">a priori</i>
  authenticated</a> [[FETCH]]. Hooking into Fetch here ensures that we catch
  not only the initial request, but all redirects as well.

  Further, Fetch calls the algorithm defined in [[#should-block-response]]
  at the bottom of the fetching algorithm in order to block <a>unauthenticated
  responses</a>. This hook is necessary to detect resources modified or
  synthesized by a ServiceWorker, as well as to determine whether a
  response is <a>unauthenticated</a> once the TLS-handshake has finished. See
  steps 4.1 and 4.2 of the algorithm defined in [[#should-block-response]] for
  detail.

  The algorithm defined in [[#categorize-settings-object]] is used by both
  [[#should-block-fetch]] and [[#should-block-response]], as well as
  [[#websockets-integration]] in order to determine whether an insecure request
  ought to be blocked.

  <section>
    <h3 id="categorize-settings-object">
      Does |settings| prohibit mixed security contexts?
    </h3>

    Both documents and workers have [=environment settings objects=] which
    may be examined according to the following algorithm in order to determine
    whether they restrict mixed content. This algorithm returns "`Prohibits
    Mixed Security Contexts`" or "`Does Not Prohibit Mixed Security Contexts`",
    as appropriate.

    Given an [=environment settings object=] (|settings|):
    
    1.  If |settings|' [=environment settings object/origin=] is
        <a><i lang="la">a priori</i> authenticated</a>., then return
        "`Prohibits Mixed Security Contexts`".

    2.  If |settings| has a <a>responsible document</a> |document|, then:

        1.  While |document| has an <a>embedding document</a>:

      If a document has an <a>embedding document</a>, a user agent needs to

  <h2 id="websockets-integration">Modifications to WebSockets</h2>

  The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/websockets/#the-websocket-interface"><code>WebSocket()</code>
  constructor algorithm</a> [[!WEBSOCKETS]] is modified as follows:

  <ul>
    <li>
      Remove the current step 2.
    </li>
  </ul>

  Note: This suggestion is filed as
  <a href="https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=28841">bug #28841</a>
  against [[WEBSOCKETS]].

  The <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-4.1">Establish a
  WebSocket Connection algorithm</a> [[!RFC6455]] is modified as follows:

  1.  After the current step 1, perform the following step:

      1.  If |secure| is `false`, and the algorithm in
          [[#categorize-settings-object]] returns "`Restricts Mixed Security
          Context`" when applied to <var ignore>client</var>'s <a>global object</a>'s
          <a>relevant settings object</a>, then the client MUST <a>fail the
          WebSocket connection</a> and abort the connection [[!RFC6455]].

  Note: Filed as
  <a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/errata_search.php?rfc=6455&eid=4398">errata #4398</a>
  against [[RFC6455]].

  These changes together mean that we'll no longer throw a `SecurityError`
  exception directly upon constructing a WebSocket object, but will instead rely
  upon blocking the connection and triggering the <a>fail the WebSocket
  connection</a> algorithm, which developers can catch by hooking a
  {{WebSocket}} object's {{WebSocket/onerror}} handler. This is consistent with
  the behavior of {{XMLHttpRequest}}, {{EventSource}}, and {{fetch()}}.

  <section>
    <h3 id="limitations">Limitations</h3>

    Blocking mixed content allows us to ensure that the guarantees discussed
    in [[#intro]] are upheld. Note, however, that those guarantees <em>only</em>
    protect developers and users against active network attackers who would
    otherwise be able to replace critical bits of code or content on the wire
    as it flows past. They <em>do not</em> protect against a compromised server
    that itself is coerced into sending corrupted resources.

    Mechanisms such as Subresource Integrity [[SRI]] are designed to deal with
    this kind of threat, and we recommend that web developers make use of them
    whenever possible.
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3 id="requirements-forms">Form Submission</h3>

    If [[#categorize-settings-object]] returns `Restricts Mixed Content` when applied to a
    {{Document}}'s [=relevant settings object=], then a user agent MAY choose to warn users of the
    presence of one or more <{form}> elements with <a element-attr>action</a> attributes whose
    values are not <a><i lang="la">a priori</i> authenticated URLs</a>.

    Note: Chrome, for example, currently gives the same UI treatment to a page with an insecure
    form action as it does for a page that displays an insecure image.

    Further, a user agent MAY treat form submissions from such a {{Document}} as a [=blockable=]
    request, even if the submission occurs in the [=top-level browsing context=].
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3 id="requirements-ux">UI Requirements</h3>

    If a user agent would normally indicate to the user that the
    <a>top-level browsing context</a> is secure, then:
   
    *   When the user agent downgrades a context to a <a>mixed security
        context</a> by returning a resource in response to a <a>mixed
        content</a> <a>request</a> (either because the <a>request</a> is
        <a>optionally-blockable</a>, or because the user agent is configured
        to allow <a>blockable</a> <a>request</a>s), the user agent MUST NOT
        provide the user with that same indication.

        The user agent SHOULD instead give an indication that <a>mixed
        content</a> is present.

    If a mixed content indication is present, it MUST be made available
    through accessibility APIs for users of assistive technologies.

    Note: This requirement holds even in the context of an   
    <a href="https://cabforum.org/about-ev-ssl/">EV status</a> [[CAB]]. An EV
    certificate's indicator does not override the necessity to notify
    users of mixed content violations.
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3 id="requirements-user-controls">User Controls</h3>

    A user agent MAY offer users the ability to directly decide whether or not
    to treat <strong>all</strong> <a>mixed content</a> as <a>blockable</a>
    (meaning that even <a>optionally-blockable</a> mixed content would be
    blocked).

    Note: It is <em>strongly recommended</em> that users take advantage of such
    an option if provided.

    A user agent MAY offer users the ability to override its decision to block
    <a>blockable</a> mixed content on a particular page.

    Note: Practically, a user agent probably can't get away with not offering
    such a back door. That said, allowing mixed script is in particular a very
    dangerous option, and each user agent
    <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6919#section-3">REALLY SHOULD NOT</a>
    [[RFC6919]] present such a choice to users without careful consideration and
    communication of the risk involved.

    Any such controls offered by a user agent MUST also be offered through
    accessibility APIs for users of assistive technologies.
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3 id="further-action">Further Action</h3>

    A user agent is encouraged to take further action above and beyond the
    requirements this document outlines in order to discourage developers from
    embedding mixed content.

    For instance, a user agent could:
    
    <ol>
      <li>
        Interpret the presence of a <code>Strict-Transport-Security</code>
        header field as forcing all content into the <a>blockable</a> category
        [[RFC6797]], or as a signal to enable <a>strict mode</a> for mixed
        content checking.
      </li>
      <li>
        Modify requests for <a>optionally-blockable</a> resources which are
        <a>mixed content</a> in order to reduce the risk to users: cookies
        and other authentication tokens could be stripped from the requests,
        automatic scheme upgrades could be attempted, and so on.
      </li>
      <li>
        Treat <a>optionally-blockable</a> resources inside <a>nested browsing
        contexts</a> as <a>blockable</a>, to allow sites to embed resources
        without fear of introducing mixed content.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </section>
</section>
<section>
  <h2 id="iana-considerations">IANA Considerations</h2>

  The Content Security Policy Directive registry should be updated with the
  following directives and references [[!RFC7762]]:
