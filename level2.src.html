  <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

  <em>This section is not normative.</em>

  When a user successfully loads a webpage from <code>example.com</code> over a
  secure channel (HTTPS, for example), the user is guaranteed that no entity
  between the user agent and <code>example.com</code> eavesdropped on or
  tampered with the data transmitted between them. However, this guarantee is
  weakened if the webpage loads subresources such as script or images over an
  insecure connection. For example, an insecurely-loaded script can allow an
  attacker to read or modify data on behalf of the user. An insecurely-loaded
  image can allow an attacker to communicate incorrect information to the user
  (e.g., a fabricated stock chart), mutate client-side state (e.g., set a
  cookie), or induce the user to take an unintended action (e.g., changing the
  label on a button). These requests are known as mixed content.

  [[!MIXED-CONTENT]] details how a user agent can mitigate these risks by
  blocking certain types of mixed content, and behaving more strictly in some
  contexts. This specification updates and extends [[!MIXED-CONTENT]] to provide
  better security and privacy guarantees while minimizing breakage.

  The core idea of this specification is <i>mixed content
  autoupgrading</i>. That is, mixed content that user agents are not already
  blocking should be autoupgraded to a secure transport. If the request cannot
  be autoupgraded, it will be blocked. Autoupgrading avoids loading insecure
  resources on secure webpages, while minimizing the amount of developer effort
  needed to avoid breakage.

    <h3 id="upgrade-algorithm">Upgrade |request| to an <i lang="la">a priori</i>
    authenticated URL as mixed content, if appropriate</h3>

    Note: The Fetch specification will hook into this algorithm to upgrade optionally-blockable
    mixed content to HTTPS.

    Given a <a>Request</a> <var>request</var>, this algorithm will rewrite
    its <a for="request">url</a> if the request is deemed to be optionally-blockable mixed content,
    via the following algorithm:

    <ol>
      <li>
        If one or more of the following conditions is met, return without modifying <var>request</var>:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <var>request</var>'s <a for="request">url</a> is an
            [[mixed-content#a-priori-authenticated-url]].
          </li>
          <li>
            [[mixed-content#categorize-settings-object]] returns "<code>Does Not Restrict Mixed Security
            Contents</code>" when applied to <var>request</var>'s <a for="request">client</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <var>request</var>'s <a for="request">mode</a> is <code>CORS</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <var>request</var>'s <a for="request">destination</a> is not "<code>image</code>",
            "<code>audio</code>", or "<code>video</code>".
          </li>
          <li>
            <var>request</var>'s <a for="request">destination</a> is "<code>image</code>"
            and <var>request</var>'s <a for="request">initiator</a> is "<code>imageset</code>".
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        If <var>request</var>'s <a for="request">url</a>'s <a for="url">scheme</a>
        is <code>http</code>,
        set <var>request</var>'s <a for="request">url</a>'s <a for="url">scheme</a>
        to <code>https</code>, and return.

        Note: Per [[url]], we do not modify the port because it will be set to null when the scheme
        is <code>http</code>, and interpreted as 443 once the scheme is changed
        to <code>https</code>

    <h3 id="modifications">Modifications to existing algorithms</h3>

    Note: This section specifies modifications to existing mixed content algorithms to ignore the
    distinction between optionally-blockable and blockable mixed content, since all
    optionally-blockable mixed content will now be autoupgraded.

    [[mixed-content#should-block-fetch]] should be modified to remove Steps 3, 4, and 5, replacing
    them with a single step "Return <strong>blocked</strong>".

    [[mixed-content#should-block-response]] should be modified to remove Steps 2, 3, and 4,
    replacing them with a single step "Return <strong>blocked</strong>".
</section>

<section>
  <h2 id="integration">Integrations</h2>

  <h3 id="fetch">Modifications to Fetch</h3>

  [[fetch#main-fetch]] should be modified to call [[#upgrade-algorithm]] on <var>request</var>
  between steps 3 and 4. That is, optionally-blockable mixed content should be autoupgraded to HTTPS
  before applying mixed content blocking.

</section>

<section>
  <h2 id="obsolescences">Obsolescences</h2>

  <h3 id="block-all-mixed-content"><code>block-all-mixed-content</code></h3>

  This specification renders the [[mixed-content#block-all-mixed-content]] CSP directive obsolete,
  because all mixed content is now blocked if it can't be autoupgraded.

  Note: The <code>upgrade-insecure-requests</code> ([[upgrade-insecure-requests]]) directive is not
  obsolete because it allows developers to upgrade blockable content. This specification only
  upgrades optionally-blockable content by default.
